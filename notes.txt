SDL_image

IMG_Init(IMG_INIT_PNG)
	call after SDL_Init

IMG_Quit
	call before SDL_Quit


SDL_CreateRenderer(window,-1,0)
	-> renderer

IMG_Load
	image file name -> surface

SDL_LoadBMP
	BMP file name to SDL_Surface

SDL_BlitSurface
	surface -> surface, with src and dest rects, same scale

SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface
	surface -> texture

SDL_UpdateTexture
	Uint32 to SDL_Texture

SDL_RenderClear
	clears with thing set by SDL_SetRenderDrawColor

SDL_RenderCopy
	SDL_Texture to SDL_Renderer, optional src and dst rects

SDL_RenderPresent
	SDL_Renderer to screen

blitting:
file name -> surface -> texture -> renderer -> screen
You want it to be a texture as fast as possible (and clean up the surface afterward) because textures use graphics memory and surfaces use cpu memory or something like that



cleaning up:

SDL_FreeSurface
SDL_DestroyTexture
SDL_DestroyRenderer
SDL_DestroyWindow
IMG_Quit
SDL_Quit
